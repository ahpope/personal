# CIS297-Winter2018-Project5-Group12

This is our Expense Tracker project for CIS297.
You can use it to create a monthly budget and track the money you spend.

To make the most out of the Expense Tracker
* Add a new Category(Expense) type (ex. Food / Gas / Utility).
* Add a new Account (ex. Checking / Savings) with an amount of money it has to start out with.
* Add a Budget - Your goal for how much you want to spend on something.
  * Choose one of your Categories.
  * Choose the month this budget applies to.
  * Money allowed in the Budget.
* Add a new Income - How much money you will receive.
  * Choose the Account that the Income will go into.
  * Choose the Month for the Income.
  * Income Amount.
 * Add a Transaction when you actually spend (or receive!) money.
  * Based on the Month, the Transactions will be compared with your Budges and Incomes for that Month
  
You can remove Categories, Accounts, Budget, and Income.
Use the Update Budget to change the amount of your Budget, by choosing a Category and Month for that Budget, and then the amount to update it by.

A Data Grid View is provided to display specifics on the data you've entered into the Database.

The View Budget section shows you info on a Budget by Category per the chosen Month.
It will give the Budget amount, total amount of Transactions in the same Category as that Budget,
  and how well you are doing by comparing your Transactions to your Budget.
  (A running total of actual should be compared with the desired goal per month.)
  
With View Account Balance, you can see the amount in each account after all Transactions are applied.
  
By clicking on View Transactions you can see all of your entered Transactions and remove any you don't like.
